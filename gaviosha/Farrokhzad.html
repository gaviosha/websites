    <p>The bird chirped: <i>What sunshine!</i>
    <br><i>Ah, what aroma! Spring has come</i>
    <br><i>and I must seek my mate...</i></p>
    
    <p>The bird unfolded off the ledge
    <br>into the air like a flown message.</p>
    
    <p>The bird was small. 
    <br>The bird was foolish. 
    <br>The bird didn't read the papers. 
    <br>The bird had no debts. 
    <br>The bird didn't know people.</p>
    
    <p>The bird in the air
    <br>high above the red lights
    <br>joyfully soared in oblivion,
    <br>deliriously lived the sky's blue moments.</p>
    
    <p>The bird,
    <br>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; ah,
    <br>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; was just a bird.</p>
